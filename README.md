### 🔍 Focus Areas

* **🤖 Machine Learning & MLOps:** Designing modular, end-to-end pipelines for predictive modeling. I focus on the entire lifecycle—from data ingestion and preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring.
* **🧠 Generative AI & RAG:** Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools like LangChain to build context-aware AI agents and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
* **🌍 Geospatial & Data Visualization:** Integrating interactive mapping (Leaflet.js) with data-driven backends to visualize complex datasets in real-time.
* **🛡️ Cybersecurity & Network Defense:** Exploring the mechanics of network security, digital forensics, and vulnerability assessment to build "secure by design" software.
* **🔭 Computational Physics:** Merging computer science with my interest in cosmology to explore how algorithms can help solve the mysteries of the universe.

### 🌌 Beyond the Code

When I'm not training models or optimizing backends:
* 🏎️ **F1 Technical Analyst:** Deeply interested in the aerodynamics, race strategy, and engineering precision of Formula 1.
* 🔭 **Cosmology Enthusiast:** Exploring astrophysics and the fundamental mysteries of dark matter, light, and black holes.
* 💪 **Discipline & Fitness:** Dedicated to personal health, weight reduction goals, and maintaining a high-performance routine.
* 📖 **Continuous Learning:** Always hunting for the next big thing in tech or science.
